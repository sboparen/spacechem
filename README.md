SpaceChem Comparison
====================

Scripts to enhance the experience of the game
[SpaceChem](http://www.spacechemthegame.com/).

The main feature is the generation of a web page based on your
uploaded solutions on [SolutionNet](http://spacechem.net/).
It all started when I decided to try to get my cycle count within
a factor of two of the best known solution on every level.
This turned out to be much harder than I thought, and also difficult
to judge from the graphs shown in the game itself.

## To do
* Indicate when the best known solutions were last updated
* Indicate users' solutions which are new
* Recent Activity
* Awards Summary
* Rivalry pages
* Challenges (no controls, no sensor, no flip flop?)
* Least cost
